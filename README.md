## Local development

### System requirements / Prerequisites
- Linux with installed Docker (or Windows with some additional configuration) [Docker Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)

- Bash shell

- GNU Make 4.x

- PHP 8.2 with modules: 
    - xml
    - curl
    - zip
    - cli
- Composer 2.5.x

- Node.js & npm

- Git installed

**To install all dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu with apt**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y make php php8.2-cli php8.2-xml php8.2-curl php8.2-zip composer npm git
```

### Configuration for local development
1. Add yourself to docker group, to run containers without sudo (you can follow guide linked above)
```bash 
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
Logout and login to apply changes, or run:
```bash
newgrp docker
```
Now make sure you can run commands without sudo
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
2.Clone this repository and go to main directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/krzysztofkozyra021/Questify.git
```
3.Prepare app environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Or, if you have all dependencies and are using Linux:
```bash
make init
```
only if you have every dependency installed (and running Linux)
> [!NOTE] 
> This command builds Docker containers, starts them, and initializes the environment.
---
4.**After make init is completed, stop the containers with command:**
```bash
make stop
```
5.Switch to branch **develop**
```bash
git checkout develop
```
6.Install all frontend and backend dependencies with:
```bash
npm install
composer install
```
7.Open a shell in the app container:
```bash
make shell
```
8.Run migrations and seed the database:
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
exit
```
9.Start the development server:
```bash
make dev
```
**App will be available at [localhost:63851](http://localhost:63851)**
